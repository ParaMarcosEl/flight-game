# 🚀 Antigravity Flight Game

A futuristic 3D racing flight simulator built with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), featuring physics-driven flight mechanics, bot opponents, checkpoint tracking, and a live minimap overlay.

## ✈️ Features

- 🌀 **Full 3D antigravity flight** with pitch, roll, and free motion  
- 🎮 **Keyboard & Gamepad support** (PlayStation-style mapping)  
- 🤖 **AI Bot Racers** that follow the same track  
- 🧭 **Checkpoint & Lap Tracking** using spline-based progress  
- 🗺️ **Mini-map HUD** with player and bot overlays  
- 🎥 **Dynamic follow camera** with smooth motion  
- 💥 **Real-time collisions** and bounce physics  
- 🧠 **Inertia-based flight physics** (damped velocity & rotation)  
- ⚙️ **Modular controllers** for aircraft, camera, game state, and race logic

## 🕹️ Controls

### Keyboard

| Key     | Action             |
|---------|--------------------|
| `W` / `S` | Pitch Up / Down   |
| `A` / `D` | Roll Left / Right |
| `I`       | Accelerate        |
| `K`       | Brake             |

### Gamepad (PlayStation-style)

| Button   | Action     |
|----------|------------|
| `X`      | Accelerate |
| `Square` | Brake      |
| Left Stick | Pitch/Roll |

> Gamepad support uses the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API)
